# Code Review Exercise - Pull Request Review

## Context
One of your team members has submitted this PR for a new service that manages user provisioning across our OpenShift clusters and AWS accounts.

## Your Role
You're the senior engineer doing the code review before this gets merged to main.

## Review Focus
Look at this code the way you'd review any teammate's PR. Consider:
- Go best practices and idioms
- Architecture and design patterns

## Format
Go through the code as you normally would in a PR review. Point out issues, suggest improvements, ask clarifying questions, and decide if you'd approve this for merge or request changes.

## Time Guidelines
- **Total Time**: ~15 minutes
- **Review Process**: 5-6 minutes skimming and questions
- **Scope**: Focus on pseudo code/logical process

## Important Notes
- Code doesn't need to compile
- There are limitless problems - we're not going to address them all
- We don't need to fix everything or pick up every issue
